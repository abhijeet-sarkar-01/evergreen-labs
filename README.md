A basic home page for an organization made using HTML and CSS.
  
This project is under construction and I plan to add updates throughout my learning journey.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED
* HTML

### *Things which I experimented with*

* Experimented a little with the hover state of an element. (Some part of the text on the right)
