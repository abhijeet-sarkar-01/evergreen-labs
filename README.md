# evergreen-labs
A basic home page for an organization made using HTML and CSS.
  
This project is under construction and I plan to add updates throughout my learning journey.
  
## TECHNOLOGIES USED
* HTML 
* CSS
  
### *Things which I experimented with*
* Tried implementing a fixed header with a shadow on top with brand logo and name on the left and a few links on the right.
* Experimented a little with the hover state of an element. (Some part of the text on the right)
